# Project 0: WDI 27 Trivia Game

Welcome to my repository for the ultimate trivia game for WDI 27 in London! For the first project for this course I created a web game for classmates to test their knowledge on how well they know each other. It is easy to follow, entertaining to play, and structured simply for those who would like to craft their own specially themed trivia game.

## Installation and Setup

Installation steps are listed below:

* Download or clone this repo
* copy `npm i` into you terminal to install dependencies
* run `gulp` in your terminal to compile the source code and open in browser
* _Enjoy_!

### A short description

You should then give a short description of the project. You should include some screenshots at this point. Images, gifs, audio files, events.


### Technologies used

These are the languages and softwares used in this game:

- HTML 5
- SCSS
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery 3.10
- Gulp
- NPM
- Git & github

A shoutout to Giphy for supplying this game with some fun backgrounds and muy bueno gifs. They are a great source for comedic material. Additionally, the kind folks at Youtube offer many soundtracks and special effects available for free download.

### Challenges faced

This game was fairly straightforward to build and conceptually made sense to me.

### Rounding it off

Finally you should say what improvements you would like to make to the project in the future. These could include things that you do not know how to do yet.

For example you might say:

- Improve the overall styling
- Complete name spacing
- Add hint or cheat option that supplies answer once in a round
- Add different levels for question difficulty
